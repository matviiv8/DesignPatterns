# Bridge Pattern

## Description

The **Bridge** pattern is a structural design pattern that separates an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to vary independently. It helps to avoid the need for a large number of subclasses when both the abstraction and the implementation can change independently.

## Use Cases

- When you want to avoid creating a large number of subclasses for every combination of abstractions and implementations.
- When both the abstraction and implementation can vary independently.

## Advantages

- Decouples abstraction and implementation, promoting flexibility and extensibility.
- Reduces the number of subclasses, leading to a cleaner design.

## Disadvantages

- Adds complexity by introducing more classes.
- May be overkill for simple systems.
