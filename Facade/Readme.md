# Prototype Pattern

## Description

The **Prototype** pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object (prototype), rather than creating a new instance from scratch. This pattern helps avoid the overhead of object creation and provides a way to clone complex objects.

## Use Cases

- When object creation is costly, and you want to reuse existing objects.
- When you need to clone complex objects with different configurations.

## Advantages

- Efficient object creation, especially when the prototype is complex.
- Allows dynamic object creation without depending on specific classes.

## Disadvantages

- Can be difficult to implement in cases where objects have deep or complex structures.
- May not be suitable for objects that have dependencies with other objects.
