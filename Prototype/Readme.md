# Prototype Pattern

## Description

The **Prototype** pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object (prototype) rather than creating a new instance from scratch. It is particularly useful when object creation is expensive or complex, allowing for object cloning instead of rebuilding.

## Use Cases

- When object creation is resource-intensive.
- When you need to clone complex objects with different configurations.

## Advantages

- Efficient object creation, reducing overhead.
- Allows dynamic object creation without depending on specific classes.

## Disadvantages

- May be complex to implement for deep or complex objects.
- Not suitable for objects with complex dependencies.
