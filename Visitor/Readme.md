# Visitor Pattern

## Description

The **Visitor** pattern is a behavioral design pattern that separates algorithms from the objects on which they operate. It allows you to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying the objects themselves. By using the visitor, you can define a new operation for an object structure without changing the classes of the elements.

## Use Cases

- When you need to perform operations on a set of objects with different interfaces.
- When you want to avoid modifying existing object structures.

## Advantages

- Adds new operations without modifying existing classes.
- Helps in managing complex object structures by centralizing operations.

## Disadvantages

- Can lead to difficulties in maintaining the code if the object structure changes frequently.
- Adding new operations requires creating new visitor classes.
