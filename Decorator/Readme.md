# Decorator Pattern

## Description

The **Decorator** pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to add new functionality to an object dynamically, without altering its structure. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending behavior.

## Use Cases

- When you need to add responsibilities to objects without modifying their classes.
- When you need to add functionality to objects in a flexible, reusable way.

## Advantages

- Enhances objects dynamically without altering their core structure.
- Allows for the creation of complex behaviors through simple, composable objects.

## Disadvantages

- Can lead to a large number of small classes that can complicate the system.
- Makes the system more complex due to added layers of decoration.
