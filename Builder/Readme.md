# Builder Pattern

## Description

The **Builder** pattern is a creational design pattern that allows for the construction of complex objects step by step. It separates the construction process from the actual object representation, enabling the creation of different representations of the same type of object.

## Use Cases

- When an object needs to be constructed with many possible configurations.
- When the construction process is complex or involves multiple steps.

## Advantages

- Encapsulates the construction logic, making the system easier to maintain and extend.
- Simplifies object creation with multiple configurations.

## Disadvantages

- Can lead to excessive class creation in simple cases.
