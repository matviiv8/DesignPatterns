# Abstract Factory Pattern 

## Description

The **Abstract Factory** is one of the creational design patterns that allows for the creation of families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. This enables a system to be independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

This pattern is especially useful when a system needs to work with multiple variants of products that can change without altering the code that uses them.

## How It Works

1. **Client** interacts with abstract factories and products, unaware of the concrete implementations.
2. **AbstractFactory** provides an interface for creating products that interact with one another.
3. The client uses factories to obtain objects without being tied to their specific types, allowing for the swapping of product families without modifying client code.

## Advantages

- Simplifies changing product families without altering client code.
- Allows adding new product variants without breaking existing code.
- Improves code organization by clearly separating object creation from usage.

## Disadvantages

- Increases the number of classes and interfaces, which can make maintaining the project more complex.
- If there are only a few product variants in the project, the pattern might be unnecessary.

## When to Use

- When a system should be independent of how its objects are created and composed.
- When a system needs to support new product variants without modifying client code.
- When a system needs to work with different product variants while maintaining interchangeability.
