# Strategy Pattern

## Description

The **Strategy** pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, places each one in a separate class, and makes their objects interchangeable. This pattern allows the client to choose the appropriate algorithm at runtime, providing flexibility and extensibility.

## Use Cases

- When you need to select an algorithm at runtime.
- When you want to define multiple variations of a behavior without changing the context that uses it.

## Advantages

- Promotes flexibility by allowing behavior to be selected dynamically.
- Encourages the open/closed principle by enabling new strategies without modifying existing code.

## Disadvantages

- Increases the number of classes if there are many strategies.
- Can complicate the system if overused.
