# Adapter Pattern

## Description

The **Adapter** pattern is a structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, converting the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects.

This pattern is useful when you want to integrate new functionality into an existing system without altering the system's code.

## Use Cases

- When you need to integrate an existing class with a new interface.
- When working with legacy code that needs to be adapted to a new system.

## Advantages

- Allows the use of existing classes without modifying them.
- Enables the integration of legacy systems into new applications.

## Disadvantages

- Increases complexity with an additional layer of abstraction.
- Can lead to inefficient code if used excessively.
