# Observer Pattern

## Description

The **Observer** pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a subscription mechanism to allow multiple objects to be notified about events occurring to the object theyâ€™re observing. This pattern is ideal for scenarios where one object (subject) changes its state, and multiple dependent objects (observers) need to be updated automatically.

## Use Cases

- Event-driven systems where many objects need to respond to a change.
- UI frameworks where different components need to reflect state changes.

## Advantages

- Loose coupling between the subject and observers.
- Allows dynamic addition or removal of observers.

## Disadvantages

- Can lead to performance issues if there are too many observers.
- The subject may become complex if it manages too many observers.
