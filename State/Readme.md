# State Pattern

## Description

The **State** pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object appears to change its class as it transitions between different states, making it easier to manage state-dependent behaviors.

## Use Cases

- When an objectâ€™s behavior depends on its internal state.
- When state transitions should be managed in a clean and maintainable way.

## Advantages

- Simplifies state-based logic by encapsulating state-specific behavior.
- Helps maintain clean and extensible code as new states can be added easily.

## Disadvantages

- Increases the number of classes if many states are needed.
- Complex to implement when state transitions are intricate.
