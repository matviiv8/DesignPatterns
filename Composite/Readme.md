# Composite Pattern

## Description

The **Composite** pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern enables clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly, making it easier to work with complex tree structures.

## Use Cases

- When you need to represent hierarchical structures.
- When you need to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

## Advantages

- Simplifies the client code by treating individual objects and composites uniformly.
- Makes it easy to add new components to the structure.

## Disadvantages

- Can lead to excessive complexity if not used carefully, especially in cases where components are not part of a natural tree structure.
